# Hey, I'm Speedy
I'm a highschool student and Rust developer. Take a look at some of my projects below:
- [ScreenCtrl](https://github.com/JustASpeedrunner/ScreenCtrl): A GUI tool to manage your monitor's brightness, using brightnessctl, and color temprature, using xsct, in Xorg.
- [SpeedyUtils](https://github.com/JustASpeedrunner/SpeedyUtils): A WIP rewrite of the GNU Core Utils in Rust.

## WIP Projects (no initial commit)
- SpeedyVPK: A GUI tool to unpack, edit, and repack Titanfall 2's VPK files. [VERY EARLY DAYS, NOT EXPECTED TO BE READY FOR A WHILE]
